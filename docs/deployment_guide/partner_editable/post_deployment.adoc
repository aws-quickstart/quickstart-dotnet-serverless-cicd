== Postdeployment steps

=== Verify the deployment

When deployment completes, go to the CodePipeline console, choose the pipeline created by the Quick Start, and review the steps.

Navigate to the Elastic Beanstalk environment created by AWS CloudFormation, choose the URL for the application, and confirm that your application sample is deployed from GitHub.

Modify the sample application code of your forked GitHub repository, and check in the changes. You will see that CodePipeline starts the CI/CD process and deploys the latest code changes to Elastic Beanstalk.
